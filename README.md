# Exploratory Data Analysis with R

A structured, week-by-week curriculum covering R programming fundamentals, statistical methodology, and data visualization. This repository is designed to guide users from basic syntax to advanced multivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## Program Objectives

This repository provides a comprehensive path to mastering data analysis using R. Key competencies covered include:

* **Statistical Foundation:** Understanding central tendency, variation, moments, and distribution scaling.
* **Data Wrangling:** Proficiency in data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing.
* **Visualization:** Mastery of both Base R graphics and the `ggplot2` ecosystem.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of linear regression and correlation analysis.
* **Specialized Analysis:** Introduction to text mining, sampling theory, and multivariate techniques.

## Course Roadmap

### Module 1: Basics and Visualization
* **Week 01: Introduction to R** – Environment setup, data types (vectors, lists), and basic syntax.
* **Week 02: Data Preparation** – Data I/O (CSV/Excel), cleaning missing values, and Frequency Distributions.
* **Week 03: 1D Visualization (Base R)** – Histograms, Boxplots, Barplots, and Stem-and-leaf plots.
* **Week 04: Advanced Graphics (ggplot2)** – Grammar of graphics, themes, facets, and complex layering.

### Module 2: Statistical Measures
* **Week 05: Central Tendency** – Arithmetic mean, weighted mean, median, and mode.
* **Week 06: Measures of Variation** – Variance, standard deviation, quartiles, and IQR.
* **Week 07: Moments** – Calculation and application of raw and central moments.
* **Week 08: Scaling and Distribution** – Skewness, Kurtosis, and data standardization/normalization.

### Module 3: Association and Modeling
* **Week 09: Continuous Variables** – Scatter plots, Covariance, and Pearson Correlation.
* **Week 10: Discrete & Rank Association** – Spearman/Kendall correlation and contingency tables.
* **Week 11: Linear Models** – Simple linear regression, the `lm()` function, and model diagnostics.
* **Week 12: Advanced Topics** – Text analysis (tokenization), sampling methods, and Multivariate EDA.
