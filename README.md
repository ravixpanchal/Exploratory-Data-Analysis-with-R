# Exploratory Data Analysis with R ✨

Welcome to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R** — a complete course-based repository covering **R fundamentals, data preparation, EDA concepts, statistical measures, visualization (base R + ggplot2), correlation, linear models, text data analysis**, and **multivariate EDA**.

This repository is structured **week-wise (Week 1 to Week 12)** with clear explanations, code, practice datasets, and mini tasks.
